    Google chrome has a bug from 2010 regarding CORS, so I read on the site
    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=67743

    In addition, answer number 262 in stackoverflow: link:

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10883211/why-does-my-http-localhost-cors-origin-not-work

    states: Chrome does not support localhost for CORS requests (a bug opened in 2010, marked WontFix in 2014).
    To get around this you can use a domain like lvh.me (which points at 127.0.0.1 just like localhost) or start chrome with the --disable-web-security flag (assuming you're just testing).
    I tried to figure out why and failed, it can be run through a server and not locally. The only solution that works for me is to change the beginning of the link like this:
    file:///C:/Users/Eitan%20Shalev/EitanShalev_balink/index.html  (run localy)
    Here's how:
    http://localhost:63343/EitanShalev_balink/index.html         (with server)
